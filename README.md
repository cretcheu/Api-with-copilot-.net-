Authentication
The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. The token is generated by the /api/auth/token endpoint and must be included in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to protected endpoints.

Generating a Token
To generate a token, send a POST request to the /api/auth/token endpoint. The response will include a token that can be used for authentication.

Example request:

curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:5000/api/auth/token'
Example response:

{
    "token": "your-jwt-token-here"
}
Using the Token
Include the token in the Authorization header of your requests to protected endpoints. The header should be in the following format:

Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token-here
Example Request with Token
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:5000/api/users/1' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token-here' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
Testing Credentials
For testing purposes, you can use the following credentials to generate a token:

Username: test
Password: password
These credentials are hardcoded in the AuthController for simplicity. In a real application, you should implement proper user authentication and validation.

Configuration
The JWT settings are configured in the appsettings.json file. Make sure to update the Key, Issuer, and Audience values to match your requirements.

{
  "Jwt": {
    "Key": "your-very-long-secret-key-that-is-at-least-32-characters-long",
    "Issuer": "your-issuer",
    "Audience": "your-audience"
  }
}
Running the Application
To run the application, use the following command:

dotnet run
The API will be available at http://localhost:5000.
